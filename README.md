# @flowtr/game-engine

This is a game engine based on the tutorials by Travis Vroman on Youtube. One main difference from the original engine is that I am using my math library, @toes/core, which includes Tensors instead of Vector3, Vector4, etc. Another large difference is that I have ported it to CommonJS because who tf uses AMD...
